                    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                    <p>Hey, this is a study project on scrollytelling, which involves a combination of scrolling and
                        motion. In other words, it's the storytelling through the scrolling of our device screens.</p>

                    <h3>Acknowledgments:</h3>
                    <p>I'd like to express my sincere thanks to <strong>Pavol Bielik</strong>, CTO of
                        <strong>LatticeFlow</strong>, for generously taking
                        the time to guide me in studying d3.js, which has enhanced my skills in web animations along
                        with THREE.js, P5.js, and GSAP.js.
                    </p>

                <section class="steps content-3">
                    <h3>Concept:</h3>
                    <p>The idea behind the study involves animating SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) by manipulating the
                        DOM through JavaScript using d3.js, along with the scroll event.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="steps content-4">
                    <p>So we can manipulate our SVG, changing colors, positions, and shapes, adding movement to the
                        content, thus creating a form of storytelling</p>

                    <h3>Web interaction:</h3>
                    <p>Web interactions are crucial, not just for grabbing attention but for crafting an immersive
                        environment. To do so, we need to grasp how to manipulate the DOM, what SVG and canvas are, and
                        there are also libraries like GSAP for animations, THREE.js for 3D on canvas, and p5.js for
                        graphic manipulation with multiple re-renders to assist us.</p>

                    <h3>D3.Js in a day</h3>
                    <p>After being introduced to d3.js, I spent half of my day studying and trying to create
                        applications. It's still quite generic, but I already have a good understanding.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="steps content-4">
                    <p>I believe that completing my journey of studying d3.js will enable me to easily incorporate it
                        into future projects with passion, as I have a deep love for front-end development. With my
                        eagerness to acquire more knowledge, I believe I can contribute significantly to
                        <strong>LatticeFlow</strong>.

                <section class="steps content-4">
                    <p>But nothing in life comes if we just stand still, so I'll keep applying myself in my quest for
                        knowledge, aiming to become a well-rounded full-stack developer while also specializing in
                        animation!</p>
